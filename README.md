# Compiling and Packaging

## Linux

You'll need the Avahi and GNU TLS developer packages to provide DNS-SD and TLS support, clang or GCC, and GNU make. Packages are targeted for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu.

Run:

    ./configure
    make dist

## OS X

You'll need the current Xcode software and command-line tools to build things. Packaging require a code signing certificate from a valid Certificate Authority - a certificate from Apple is not sufficient for general distribution.

Run:

    ./configure
    CODESIGN_IDENTITY="common name" make dist

## Windows

You'll need the current Visual Studio C++ as well as the code signing tools and a code signing certificate from a valid Certificate Authority.

Open the "ippeveselfcert.sln" file in the "vcnet" subdirectory and build the installer project.
